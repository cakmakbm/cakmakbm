# 👋 Hi, I'm Metehan

I’m a Computer Engineering student at Marmara University. I build projects in **game development (Unity/C#)**, **software engineering (Java/C#)**, and **data/analytics (Python + SQL + Jupyter)**.  
My goal is to grow both a **game + backend focused portfolio** and **data engineering skills** in parallel.

## 🔭 Featured Projects

### 🎮 Games & Interactive
- **[CubeSlide](https://github.com/cakmakbm/CubeSlide)** — Unity & C# “Cube Surfer” style mobile clone.  
  Includes swerve input, cube stacking/collecting, obstacle mechanics, camera tracking, and game state management.

- **[SaverBoat](https://github.com/cakmakbm/SaverBoat)** — Unity project featuring ShaderLab, C#, and HLSL for water/boat gameplay.  
  Focused on shaders and interactive boat mechanics.

- **[TrafficSimulatorGame](https://github.com/cakmakbm/TrafficSimulatorGame)** — Traffic simulation built with JavaFX.  
  Features traffic lights, roads, cars, collision logic, level loading, and object-oriented architecture.

### 📊 Data & Analytics
- **[Stock Market Data Analytics](https://github.com/cakmakbm/stock-market-data-analytics)** — Data analysis of Tesla & GameStop stock prices and revenue.  
  Uses yfinance, pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Plotly for interactive charts and insights.

- **[Chicago Socioeconomic • School • Crime](https://github.com/cakmakbm/chicago-crime-census-school-data)** — Combines Chicago socioeconomic, school, and crime datasets into a single SQLite database for SQL-based analysis.

- **[Chicago Schools Data](https://github.com/cakmakbm/chicago-schools-data)** — Jupyter & SQL exploration of Chicago public schools dataset.
